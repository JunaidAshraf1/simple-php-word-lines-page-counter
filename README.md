--Project Description--
It is a collection of simple tools to analye and generate .PDF, .DOCX, .DOC and .TXT files Word Count, Line Count and Page Count. Sometimes it becomes really hassle to get these information, I faced the same problem, I was not able to find much helpful tools to get these information, there are some tools which were available but either does not support all the mentioned file type or were not free, these are mostly websites so we are not in control to use it our way and make use of the tool as am API to use in your project.

It is a one of the simplest PHP script available to analyse and count the Word, Lines and Pages of the supported documents.

I hope this little script will help you.

--To use the script as API--
PHP code to handle the file upload and give results is written on the index page itself, so if you want to use this script as a API then then you can move all the PHP script to some other file and use that file as an endpoint script to handle request and give response or simple remove all the HTML code from index.php and let that be the endpoint. Send POST requests with file as name "fileToUpload". That's it.

--Note:- File upload folder will be created automatically by default it will be "files/". If you face any problems you make create the folder. The files will be deleted from the folder after giving the results.
